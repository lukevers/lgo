# lgo - Literate Go

A CLI to build Literate Go (lgo) files.

## What's Literate Go?

Literate Go is the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language, but with a [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) twist.

This specific tool assumes that your lgo files are basically [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files with code in triple back-tick blocks. You may include the language name in the triple back-tick blocks if you wish, but it's not required at this time.
